        This is the first gadget I've ever made on my own, an anonymous chat
        room.
      </div>
      <div>
        I get the idea from the hack.chat, and I want to make a chat room like
        that by using React and Rust.
      </div>
      <div>
        I don't want to use UI libraries like mui, this time I want it to be
        more natural.
      </div>
